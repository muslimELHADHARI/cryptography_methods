## Introduction

Cryptography is the practice of secure communication in the presence of third parties. This repository covers various cryptographic methods, providing implementations, explanations, and examples to help you understand and apply these techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/muslimELHADHARI/cryptography_methods.git
cd cryptography-methods

## Cryptographic Methods

### SymmetricCryptosystems

Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption. This section includes implementations and explanations for algorithms such as:

- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- Ceaser Cipher
- Vegenere Cipher
- OTP

### AssymmetricCryptosystems

Asymmetric encryption algorithms use a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. This section covers algorithms such as:

- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- Diffie Hellman key exchange

### EllipticCurvesCryptosystems

Works on Elliptic curves cryptosystem and learn how it work:

- ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
### HashingAlgorithms

Hash functions produce a fixed-size hash value from input data. This section includes implementations for:

- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
- MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)


## Usage

Refer to the individual folders and files for detailed instructions on how to use each cryptographic method. For example, you might find a README.md file within each method's directory with specific usage instructions.
